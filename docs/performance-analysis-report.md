├── Type Checking: ~171ms (reasonable for codebase size)
├── Test Execution: ⚠️ No tests found in configured paths
├── E2E Configuration: ✅ Comprehensive Playwright setup
└── Development Server: Fast Vite HMR enabled
```

#### Critical Issues
1. **Build Failure**: TypeScript compilation not working due to missing/incorrect configuration
2. **Test Discovery**: Jest configuration not finding test files (path mismatch)

  - Complex form render: <200ms  
  - Large form render: <500ms
  - Field updates: <16ms (60fps target)
  - Form submission: <100ms
  - File upload processing: <50ms

#### Core Web Vitals Implementation
The test suite includes proper Core Web Vitals monitoring:
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: <2.5s target
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: <100ms target  
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: <0.1 target

### 5. Memory Usage Analysis

#### Frontend Memory Patterns
```javascript
// Identified optimization opportunities:
- Virtual scrolling implemented for large forms
- Memory leak prevention in form lifecycle
- DOM optimization with viewport-based rendering
- Efficient event handling patterns
```

#### Backend Memory Considerations
- SQLAlchemy session management appears proper
- Background task processing prevents memory accumulation
